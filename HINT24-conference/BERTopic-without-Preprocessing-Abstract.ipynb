However, since network connections between the medical devices and the monitoring system are intermittent, the file does not contain a contiguous stream of data for each medical device. The file pauses recording during gaps in network connectivity. The system displays current data, as well as a list of alarms. If medical personnel wish to view more detail about an earlier time or one of the alarms, the system calculates where in the file the medical device data was recorded. This calculation accounts for the discontiguous nature of the data. The system uses times the network connection is made and broken to calculate an index into the file that corresponds to the time of the user-selected alarm.'"
